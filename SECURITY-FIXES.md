# Security Fixes Implementation

## 🚨 Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. **Exposed SendGrid API Key** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: SendGrid API key was exposed in client-side bundle via `VITE_SENDGRID_API_KEY`
**Fix**: 
- Moved email processing to secure serverless function (`/api/submit-intake.ts`)
- API key now stored server-side only in Vercel environment variables
- Client-side code only makes API calls, no direct SendGrid access

### 2. **Client-Side Validation Bypass** ✅ FIXED  
**Issue**: All validation and rate limiting was client-side and could be bypassed
**Fix**:
- Implemented comprehensive server-side validation in serverless function
- Rate limiting by IP address on server
- Input sanitization and validation on server
- Client-side validation is now just UX enhancement

### 3. **PII in Console Logs** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Email content and addresses logged to console in production
**Fix**:
- Removed all console logging of sensitive data
- Build configuration strips console logs in production (`drop_console: true`)
- Server-side logging only includes success/failure status

### 4. **Weak Phone Number Validation** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Server validation only checked length, not format
**Fix**:
- Added proper international phone regex validation
- Server validates both format and length (7-16 digits)
- Consistent validation between client and server

### 5. **CSP 'unsafe-inline'** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Content Security Policy allowed inline scripts/styles
**Fix**:
- Moved inline Tailwind config to external file (`/src/tailwind.config.js`)
- Moved inline styles to CSS file
- Removed `'unsafe-inline'` from CSP headers

### 6. **Missing Dependency Auditing** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: No automated security dependency checking
**Fix**:
- Added npm audit scripts to `package.json`
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated security auditing
- Weekly scheduled security scans
- Build fails on high-severity vulnerabilities

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### Before (Insecure)
```
Browser → Client-side validation → SendGrid API (exposed key)
```

### After (Secure)
```
Browser → Serverless Function → Server validation → SendGrid API (protected key)
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Serverless Function (`/api/submit-intake.ts`)
- **Rate Limiting**: 3 requests per minute per IP
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS protection, length limits
- **Validation**: Email format, phone format, required fields
- **Error Handling**: No internal error exposure
- **CORS**: Restricted to production domain

### Client-Side (`/src/api/intake.ts`)
- **Simple API calls**: No sensitive logic
- **Error handling**: User-friendly messages only
- **No secrets**: Zero sensitive information

### Build Security
- **Console stripping**: All console logs removed in production
- **Source maps**: Disabled to prevent code exposure
- **Minification**: Terser with security optimizations

### CI/CD Security
- **Automated auditing**: Weekly dependency scans
- **Vulnerability blocking**: High-severity issues fail builds
- **Secret scanning**: Build artifacts checked for exposed secrets

## 📋 Security Checklist

- ✅ API keys moved to server-side environment variables
- ✅ Server-side validation and sanitization implemented
- ✅ Rate limiting by IP address
- ✅ Console logs stripped from production builds
- ✅ CSP hardened (no 'unsafe-inline')
- ✅ Dependency auditing automated
- ✅ GitHub Actions security workflow
- ✅ Phone number validation strengthened
- ✅ Error messages sanitized (no internal details exposed)
- ✅ CORS properly configured

## 🚀 Deployment Requirements

### Vercel Environment Variables
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_actual_sendgrid_key_here
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test serverless function locally
vercel dev
node test-serverless.mjs

# Run security audit
npm run security-check

# Build and check for secrets
npm run build
grep -r "SENDGRID_API_KEY\|password\|secret" dist/
```

## 📊 Security Metrics

- **API Key Exposure**: ❌ → ✅ (Eliminated)
- **Validation Bypass**: ❌ → ✅ (Server-side enforced)
- **PII Logging**: ❌ → ✅ (Eliminated)
- **CSP Score**: ⚠️ → ✅ (Hardened)
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: ⚠️ → ✅ (Monitored)

All critical security issues have been resolved. The application now follows security best practices with proper separation of client/server concerns and comprehensive protection against common web vulnerabilities.
